Very simple and powerful state management solution for any application built on Laco and Immer.

Set up your stores and subscribe to them. Easy as that!

`npm install lacer`

## Summary
- :rocket: Simple to use
- :tada: Lightweight (<2kbs gzipped)
- :sparkles: Partial [Redux DevTools Extension](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension) support (time travel thanks to Laco)

## Example
```javascript
import { Store } from 'lacer'

// Creating a new store with an initial state { count: 0 }
const CounterStore = new Store({ count: 0 })

// Implementing some actions to update the store
const increment = () => CounterStore.set((state) => state.count++)
const decrement = () => CounterStore.set((state) => state.count--)

increment()
expect(CounterStore.get().count).toBe(1) // Success

decrement()
expect(CounterStore.get().count).toBe(0) // Success
```

### Time travel
Just click on the stopwatch icon and you will get a slider which you can play with.
That's it! :)

### Time travel
Works as you would expect :)!

## API
### `Store<T>(initialState: T, name?: string)`
```typescript
// Initializing a new store with an initial state and a name:
interface INewStore = {
  count: number
}

const NewStore = Store<INewStore>({ count: 0 }, "Counter")
```
The name is optional and is used to get an overview of action and store relationship in Redux DevTools Extension. Action names for the Store will now show up as `Counter - ${actionType}` in DevTools Extension where as before only `${actionType}` was shown.

### `Store.get(): T`
```javascript
// Getting the state of the store
Store.get()
```
Returns an object which could be something like `{ count: 0 }` following the example.

### `Store.set(state: SetStateFunc, info?: string)`
`type SetStateFunc<T> = (state: Draft<T> => void)`
Technically, this function does allow any value to be returned to allow patterns similar to what you'll see in the example where the assignment is returned. **However, the return value is ignored.**

T inherits from the generic specified during the initalization of the Store. The SetStateFunc provides a `Draft<T>` from Immer. For more information on how to use Immer, [check it out here](https://immerjs.github.io/immer/docs/introduction).
```javascript
// Setting a new state and passing an optional action name "increment"
Store.set((state) => (state.count++), "increment")
```

### `Store.replace(state: ReplaceStateFunc<, info?: String)`
`type ReplaceStateFunc<T> = (state: T) => T`

T inherits from the generic specified during the initalization of the Store. This function allows you to completely replace the object used in the store and fires all subscription handlers afterwards regardless of the properties they listen to.
```javascript
// Setting a new state and passing an optional action name "increment"
Store.replace((state) => { /* return modified state */}, "increment")
```

### `Store.setMiddleware(middleware: MiddlewareFunc)`
`type MiddlewareFunc<T> = (state: T, actionType?: string) => T | boolean`

A middleware will intercept a state change (set or replace) before it is made. If the middleware returns false, the change is discarded. If it returns true, the next middleware will run. If it returns an object of the same type as the Store, the state will be replaced with that type.

Note: You can mutate this object freely since it is generated by Immer.
```javascript
// Setting a condition to prevent count from going below 0
// and a special case for `SudoDecrement` action which CAN make count go below 0
CounterStore.setMiddleware((state, actiontype) => state.count < 0 && actionType === 'SudoDecrement')
```

### `Store.reset()`
```javascript
// Resets the store to initial state
Store.reset()
```
Reset will bring back the original state of the Store when it was initialized. This is stored in `Store.initialState`.

### `Store.dispatch(value: any, info: String)`
```javascript
// Dispatching an action that does not change the state of the store
Store.dispatch(changeLocation(), "Location change")
```
You might want to dispatch an action that is associated with a certain store but don't want to change the state. The action will in this case be shown as `StoreName - Location change`.

### `dispatch(value: any, info: String)`
```javascript
import { dispatch } from 'lacer'

// Dispatching a global action that does not change any state
dispatch(changeLocation(), "Location change")
```
You might want to dispatch a global action that is **NOT** associated with any store. The action will in this case just be shown as `Location change`.

## Testing
Testing using [jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest):
```javascript
import { ICounterState } from '/types'
import { Store } from 'lacer'

test('CounterStore simple actions', () => {
  // Creating a new store with an initial state { count: 0 }
  const CounterStore = new Store<ICounterState>({ count: 0 }, 'Counter')

  // Implementing an action to update the store
  const increment = () => CounterStore.set((prev) => prev.count++, 'Increment')

  expect(CounterStore.get().count).toBe(0)

  increment()
  expect(CounterStore.get().count).toBe(1)
})
```
